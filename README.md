# Exotic Fruits Web Shop (HTML Prototype)

This repository contains a static prototype of an exotic fruits web shop implemented in plain HTML for the Practical Web Technologies course. 
It includes a homepage, regional category lists (e.g., Asia, South America) with sub-category pages, product list stubs, login/registration, customer profile with sample data, about, and logout views wired via relative links. 
The code is intentionally HTML-only at this stage to prepare for later CSS/JS/Backend tasks.

## Pages
- index.html  
- asiaList.html, southAmericaList.html  
- japanList.html, thailandList.html, peruList.html, brazilList.html  
- login.html, registration.html  
- customer.html, about.html, logout.html

## Scope
- Navigation and forms only; no CSS/JS styling and backend not implemented yet.
